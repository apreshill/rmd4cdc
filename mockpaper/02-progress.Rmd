# Basic sanity checking/EDA here


```{r}

# skim(mockdata)

mockdata %>% 
  group_by(arm) %>% 
  skim()
```


# Make table one here

Let's make a basic Table 1 grouped by arm with details on sex and age in each group.

```{r results="asis"}
#summary by groups
tab1 <- tableby(arm ~ sex + age, data = mockdata)
summary(tab1, text=TRUE)
```

Let's make a Table 1 - but ungrouped, with stats on BMI, sex, Age in each group.

```{r results="asis"}
#summary without groups
tab.noby <- tableby(~ bmi + sex + age, data = mockdata)
summary(tab.noby)
```

Let's make a Table 1 but now control # of digits

```{r results="asis"}
summary(tableby(arm ~ sex + fu_time, data = mockdata), 
        digits = 4, digits.p = 2, digits.pct = 1)
```

# Run some stats and make a table here

Arm x fu_stat chi square table (1 = lived, 2 = died)

```{r}
mockdata %>% 
  tabyl(arm, fu_stat) %>% 
  adorn_totals("row") %>% # can also do "col", or c("row", "col")
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


```{r}
mockdata %>% 
  mutate(fu_fct = as.factor(fu_stat)) %>% 
  specify(fu_fct ~ arm) %>% # alt: response = fu_stat, explanatory = arm
  calculate(stat = "Chisq")
```


```{r eval = FALSE}
mockdata %>% 
  mutate(fu_fct = as.factor(fu_stat)) %>% 
  specify(formula = fu_stat ~ arm, success = "1") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("1", "2"))
```

make bar/lollipop chart of proportions here (% survived)

Start with a barplot
for percent survival
tag it as panel A for a multipanel plot

```{r survival_barplot}
mockdata %>% 
  group_by(arm) %>% 
  summarize(surv = length(which(fu_stat==1)),
         died = length(which(fu_stat==2)),
         pct_surv = surv*100/(died+surv)) %>% 
  select(arm, surv, died, pct_surv) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=arm, y = pct_surv, fill=arm) +
  geom_col(colour = "gray") +
  labs(y= "Percent Survived", x= "Study Arm", tag ="A") +
  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = 'nuuk')  ->
p1

p1
```

Then distribution plot of survival time (in days censored)

```{r}
ggplot(mockdata) +
  aes(x=arm, y = fu_time, fill=arm) +
  geom_jitter(width =0.25, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_violin(alpha =0.3) +
  labs(y= "Survival Time in \nDays (Censored)", x= "Study Arm", tag = "B") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_scico_d(palette = 'nuuk') ->
p2

p2
```


(for colors, maybe show `scale_fill_gray` + `scico`)
